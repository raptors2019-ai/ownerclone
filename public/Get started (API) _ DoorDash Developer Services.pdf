Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have created and saved an access key from the Developer Portal.

To continue, you will need: developer_id, key_id and signing_secret

Install a JWT library
Most programming languages provide support for creating JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) either directly in the language or as a package. Select your language and then follow the instructions to install the package, if needed.

Node.js
Python
PHP
Java
Kotlin
C#
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run:

npm install jsonwebtoken

Generate a JWT
JWTs are created using an access key. Use these code snippets to generate a correctly-formatted JWT from your access key.

Node.js
Python
PHP
Java
Kotlin
C#
Copy the code snippet below into your project file. Replace PASTE_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE with your access key.

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')

const accessKey = PASTE_YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE

const data = {
  aud: 'doordash',
  iss: accessKey.developer_id,
  kid: accessKey.key_id,
  exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000 + 300),
  iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
}

const headers = { algorithm: 'HS256', header: { 'dd-ver': 'DD-JWT-V1' } }

const token = jwt.sign(
  data,
  Buffer.from(accessKey.signing_secret, 'base64'),
  headers,
)

console.log(token)

Then, test your code. In your terminal, run:

node app.js

If you were successful, you should see output like this:

Create a delivery
Now that you have a JWT, you can create a delivery by making a request to the Drive API.

tip
When you created your access key, you created it for the Sandbox environment (until you request production access, you can only create access keys for the Sandbox environment). Because you're using an access key for the Sandbox environment, you can experiment with the API as much as you like without incurring real costs or hailing real Dashers.

Node.js
Python
PHP
Kotlin
C#
First, install the axios npm package.

npm install axios

Then, copy the snippet below into app.js, at the end of the file.

const axios = require('axios')

const body = JSON.stringify({
  external_delivery_id: 'D-12345',
  pickup_address: '901 Market Street 6th Floor San Francisco, CA 94103',
  pickup_business_name: 'Wells Fargo SF Downtown',
  pickup_phone_number: '+16505555555',
  pickup_instructions: 'Enter gate code 1234 on the callbox.',
  dropoff_address: '901 Market Street 6th Floor San Francisco, CA 94103',
  dropoff_business_name: 'Wells Fargo SF Downtown',
  dropoff_phone_number: '+16505555555',
  dropoff_instructions: 'Enter gate code 1234 on the callbox.',
  order_value: 1999,
})

axios
  .post('https://openapi.doordash.com/drive/v2/deliveries', body, {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data)
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error)
  })

Test your code. In your terminal, run:

node app.js

If you were successful, you should see output like this:

Use the Delivery Simulator
You can use the Delivery Simulator to advance your delivery through the stages of the delivery process, from creation to Dasher assignment to pickup to delivery.

In the Developer Portal left navigation, click Simulator.

Find the delivery you created by looking for the identifier #D-12345. Click Advance to Next Step to move your delivery to the Delivery Confirmed stage.

Get the status of your delivery
You can always get the latest status of a delivery by making a request to the Drive API.

Node.js
Python
PHP
Kotlin
C#
First, delete or comment out the request to create a delivery. If you don't, your code will try to create another delivery and run into a conflict.

// axios
//   .post('https://openapi.doordash.com/drive/v2/deliveries', body, {
//     headers: {
//       Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token,
//       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
//     },
//   })
//   .then(function (response) {
//     console.log(response.data)
//   })
//   .catch(function (error) {
//     console.log(error)
//   })

Copy the snippet below into app.js at the end of the file.

axios
  .get('https://openapi.doordash.com/drive/v2/deliveries/D-12345', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response.data)
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error)
  })

Then, test your code. In your terminal, run:

node app.js

If you were successful, you should see output like this. Notice that the delivery_status is enroute_to_pickup.

Finish up
If you'd like, continue to use the Delivery Simulator to advance your delivery through the stages of the delivery process and then re-run your app to see how the delivery details change.
